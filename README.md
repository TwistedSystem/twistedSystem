# twistedSystem
iOS game developed in C++ in 2015. Game traits based similarly to Fuzion Frenzy's Twisted System developed by Blitz Games, released in 2001. A single player (for version 1.0) attempts to jump and duck under objects. There is a counter which counts how many objects the player successfully avoids. After 5 collisions with between the player and an object, the game is over. The final count is displayed the entire time, with the final score being the user's overall goal (to increase that number). We'll store the user's highest score in the menu along with some additional features like the ability to switch between swiping and hitting a UI Button.
